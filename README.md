# LangChain Project

This is a sample LangChain project that demonstrates the power and flexibility of LangChain for building advanced language model-driven applications. LangChain is a framework that makes it easy to create and manage chains of language models, integrate with external data sources, and handle complex workflows.

## Project Overview

This project uses LangChain to integrate various tools and data sources into a cohesive application. The goal is to show how you can leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in real-world tasks such as document processing, web scraping, and building custom agents.

## Requirements

- node.js
- LangChain library
- OpenAI (or another LLM provider) API key (for LLM-based operations)
- Other dependencies (specified in `requirements.txt`)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Puran06/one_month_intern.git
cd langchain-project
